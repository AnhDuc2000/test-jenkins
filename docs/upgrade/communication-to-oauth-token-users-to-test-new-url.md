Hello,

We are planning to migrate Confluence instance to a new AWS environment on February 18th, 2020. This Confluence migration will enable automated deployments, which will reduce future user downtime significantly and/or completely for upgrades, infrastructure re-sizing, etc.  The communication for this will be sent out shortly.

Your team is currently using the OAuth token accessing to https://confluence.csc.com.  The new Confluence URL will be https://confluence.dxc.com.  Your currently OAuth token should be working with the new URL, but we need your help to test your script using your OAuth token with this new Confluence URL and let us know if there is any issue.

Please note this new URL contains the latest data up to January 31, 2020.

We are not publicly announcing the new URL to the Confluence users yet until the implementation is complete on February 18th, 2020.  So please help us to not sharing this new URL to other Confluence users.

Please only use the new URL for testing purposes. Any work you do will be lost during migration.

Thank You!!

Best regards,

DevCloud Team
