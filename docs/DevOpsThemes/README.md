# DevOps Improvement Themes for Confluence

The following improvement themes were identified for Confluence product and supporting team.

These should be considered living documents, and as each next target state (plateau) is reached the next state can be identified with clear next steps.

Identifying the steps is key as they provide a roadmap for the creation of explicit Agile user stories to attain the next target condition.
