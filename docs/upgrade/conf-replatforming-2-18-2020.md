**IMPORTANT: DXC Confluence Migration scheduled for Tuesday, February 18th, 2020**

To improve the DXC Confluence service, we are planning to migrate the system to a new AWS environment and rebrand the URL on February 18th, 2020. This Confluence migration will enable automated deployments using CI/CD pipeline concepts, which will reduce and in some cases eliminate downtime for future updates, infrastructure re-sizing, etc.  To most users, the migration will be transparent and is being done during our lowest activity period.

During most of the implementation window Confluence will set to be "read only" mode and no user updates to Confluence will be able to be made.  Users will experience a short 5 min downtime towards the end of the implementation window while user traffic is re-directed to the new Confluence instance.  Please plan your work accordingly, though we expect the migration to be transparent to most users.

**Implementation Start:**  Tuesday February 18th @ 16:00 CST
  *	Confluence will be READ-ONLY 

**Implementation End:**  Tuesday February 18th @ 21:00 CST 

**User Impact - Please read carefully**
  *	After implementation, confluence.csc.com will be redirected to a new Confluence URL 
  *	The new Confluence URL will be disclosed AFTER implementation so that users may correct their bookmarks
  * The IP Address of the Confluence system will change, so if you have added custom firewalls, please contact us for coordination
  * Any Confluence attachments loaded the day prior to the migration may be inaccessible until three hours after the migration starts
  * Updates pertaining to this implementation will be posted on DevCloud group on [DevCloud@workplace](https://dxc.workplace.com/groups/DevCloud/)

If there are any questions or issues, please post on DevCloud group on [DevCloud@workplace](https://dxc.workplace.com/groups/DevCloud/) . 

Regards, DevCloud Team
