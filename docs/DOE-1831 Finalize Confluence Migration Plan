Confluence cloud site migration steps to Confluence Server

## Overview
This document will detail a high level serviceMesh migration plan for Confluence. We will migrate data from our cloud site to our site Server. 
It encompasses using the backup manager at the server level to import an already snapshot of our cloud site..

###
Pre-migration checklist
* Check that you have System Administrator global permissions in Confluence Server, and Site Administrator permissions in your cloud site.
* It is recommended backing up our current Confluence Cloud site. If the destination Server site has existing data, back up our Confluence Server site as well
* Work with and notify users prior to migration effort
* Determine duplicate spacekeys and rename or move to a different name


### Systems

* ConfluencePentest: https://confluencepentest.dxcdevcloud.net
* Confluence Cloud : https://dxcconfluence.atlassian.net


### Assumptions

* Required plug-ins and versions are compared and aligned
* Backup Manager is configured for Export and Import.

Post-Migration:
Review migrated data of confluence server: 
to ensure your data and attachments have migrated successfully. 

Recommendations:
Check spaces for common things, e.g. comments, attachments, and permissions.
Allow time for different teams and users to test the operation and functionality of the application to identify 
any behavior gaps. If needed, we may want to document them for our users.
