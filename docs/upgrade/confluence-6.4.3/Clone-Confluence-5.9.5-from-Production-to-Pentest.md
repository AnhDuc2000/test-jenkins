Clone Confluence 5.9.5 from Production to Pentest
=================================================

Clone MySQL DB from Production to Pentest (20 min)
--------------------------------------------------
	AWS Prod (7 mins)
		Go to RDS > Instance  (6 mins)
			Select "cz-mysqldb"
				on "Instance actions"
					select "Take snapshot"
						Name the snapshot "cz-mysqldb-confluence-2-pentest-2018-07-01"
				
		goto to RDS > Snapshots  (1 min)
			search snapshot "cz-mysqldb-confluence-2-pentest-2018-07-01" with filter "Owned by Me"
			select found "cz-mysqldb-confluence-2-pentest-2018-07-01"
					On "Actions"
						select "Share Snapshot"
		
	AWS Pentest (13 mins)
		Go to RDS > Snapshots
			Filter snapshots by "All Public Snapshots" 
				Search for Snapshots "cz-mysqldb-confluence-2-pentest-2018-07-01"
				Select the found snapshot "cz-mysqldb-confluence-2-pentest-2018-07-01"
					On "Actions"
						select "Restore Snapshot" 
						
							DB Engine = MySQL Community Edition
							License Model = general-public-license
							DB Instance Class = db.t2.medium -- 2 vCPU, 4 GiB RAM
							Multi-AZ Deployment = No
							Storage type = General Purpose (SSD)
							DB Instance Identifier = pentest-confluence-20180701
							Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) = Default VPC (vpc-b4d3e7d0)
							Subnet group = default
							Public accessibility = Yes
							Availability zone = us-east-1a
							Option Group = default:mysql-5-6

							Maintenance = Yes
							
								Process Status:
									creating	= 5:19pm --> 5:23pm
									backing-up	= 5:23pm --> 5:25pm
									modifying	= 5:25pm --> 5:26pm
						
			Create a backup (snapshot) before migrating the MySQL db from 5.6.27 to 5.6.39.
				Create a snapshot of "pentest-confluence-20180701" and name it as "pentest-confluence-20180701-mysql-5-6-27" before upgrading to MySQL 5.6.39" (1:59 pm - 2:00pm) (note snapshot will retain within time limited (7days?).  If we want to keep it for longer, then need to create a backup db instance of it.
					Create a db instance from this snapshot (backing-up (1.47 pm -- 1:53pm) -- modifying (1:53 pm - 1:54pm)
						On "Actions"
							select "Restore Snapshot" 
								** Follow the steps above but set "DB Instance Identifier = pentest-confluence-20180701-mysql-5-6-27"

Clone Confluence 5.9.5 from Production to Pentest (7 min)
----------------------------------------------------------
	Go to prod node1 (pub:52.73.177.83  -- prt:10.0.0.197) and zip folder "/opt/atlassian"  (Note: to prevent files locked, it is better to stop Confluence when zipping this folder)  (6:47pm -- 6:51 pm)
		cd /opt
		tar -czvf atlassian-5.9.5-node1.tar.gz atlassian 			
		
	copy the tar file "atlassian-5.9.5-node1.tar.gz" to node 1 on Confluence pentest linux server.	(6:53 pm - 6:54 pm)
		scp -i /home/ec2-user/devcloud-pentest-useast1.pem /opt/atlassian-5.9.5-node1.tar.gz ec2-user@18.233.217.63:/tmp 			


​	
Clone the EFS of Confluence 5.9.5 to Pentest (~ 4 hours)
--------------------------------------------------------
	Go to prod node 3 backup (Public DNS(IPv4)=ec2-54-210-129-196.compute-1.amazonaws.com) and copy the "/efs-bak" to pentest node 1.  
	
	Before doing this, 
		- disable rsync job in 'crontab'
			sudo su
			crontab -e
				Add a "#" in front of line one like "#0 10,22 * * * /usr/local/bin/confluence-rsync-efs.sh" and save the file
		- confirm there is no existing folder "confluence-shared-home" and the user "ec2-user" has full access to this folder "/efs" on pentest node 1. If you get permission error, create a temp folder under "/efs" and grant full permission for this temp folder and scp to this temp folder.
					
		sudo su		
		scp -ri /home/ec2-user/devcloud-pentest-useast1.pem /efs-bak ec2-user@18.233.217.63:/efs
			
	After done, enable rsync job on prod node 3
		sudo su
		crontab -e
			Remove a "#" in front of line one like "0 10,22 * * * /usr/local/bin/confluence-rsync-efs.sh" and save the file

Setup Confluence 5.9.5 on Pentest (20 min)
---------------------------------	
	Go to pentest node 1
		sudo su
		cd /opt
		cp /tmp/atlassian-5.9.5-node1.tar.gz .
		chown root:root atlassian-5.9.5-node1.tar.gz
	
	make sure no confluence instance is running.  If yes, then stop it
	make sure there is no folder "atlassian" in this folder "/opt".  If yes, then rename it.	
	extract the tar file and make sure the tar file is owned by root after copied (6:55pm - 6:58pm)
		tar -xzvf atlassian-5.9.5-node1.tar.gz
	
	confirm the owner 'confluence' on the extracted folders "/opt/atlassian/confluence-data"
		
	change cluster configuration file 
		vi /opt/atlassian/confluence-data/confluence.cfg.xml
			from:
				<property name="confluence.cluster.peers">10.0.0.197,10.0.0.245</property>
				<property name="confluence.setup.server.id">B86M-QIKQ-CZ9U-4BPT</property>
				<property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mysql://cz-mysqldb.cb53usaz5oke.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com/confluence_db?sessionVariables=storage_engine%3DInnoDB</property>
	
			to:

	change tomcat server configuration file for proxyName "jirapentest.dxcdevcloud.net" 
		vi /opt/atlassian/confluence/conf/server.xml					
			from:
				<Connector port="8080" proxyName="confluence.csc.com" proxyPort="443" scheme="https" secure="true" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443"
			
			to:
				<Connector port="8090" proxyName="confluencepentest.dxcdevcloud.net" proxyPort="443" scheme="https" secure="true" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443"
			
	Rebuilding the Content Indexes from Scratch by deleting the content of these two folders 
		cd /opt/atlassian/confluence-data/index
		rm -rf *
		
		this folder "journal" contains a lot of files so need to delete the whole folder and recreate it.  Otherwise, you might get error
			cd /opt/atlassian/confluence-data
			rm -rf journal
			mkdir journal
			chown confluence:confluence journal
			chmod 700 journal
			
	Remove files in plugin cache folders.  
		cd /opt/atlassian/confluence-data/bundled-plugins
		rm -rf *
		
		cd /opt/atlassian/confluence-data/plugins-cache
		rm -rf *
		
		cd /opt/atlassian/confluence-data/plugins-osgi-cache
		rm -rf *
		
		cd /opt/atlassian/confluence-data/plugins-temp
		rm -rf *
		
	Remove files in temp folder 
		cd /opt/atlassian/confluence-data/temp
		rm -rf *
				
	Remove files in Tomcat logs folder and Confluence data logs folder 
		cd /opt/atlassian/confluence-data/logs
		rm -rf *
	
		cd /opt/atlassian/confluence/logs
		rm -rf *
		
	Increase the max backup log file to 25 so we can have records of all activities and not overwritten by default of 5 files 
		vi /opt/atlassian/confluence/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties
		log4j.appender.confluencelog.MaxBackupIndex=25


​		
MySQL DB (3 min)
----------------
	
	Programmatically changing Server Base URL
	When copy the product to pentest, the prod is using the SAML Plugin which has configuration to redirect to the based URL and you can not login to Pentest.  So need to change the SERVER Base URL to get into the JIRA pentest.		
		update BANDANA set BANDANAVALUE = replace(BANDANAVALUE, 'https://confluence.csc.com', 'https://confluencepentest.dxcdevcloud.net') where BANDANACONTEXT = '_GLOBAL' and BANDANAKEY = 'atlassian.confluence.settings';
	
	Change Server ID	
		update BANDANA set bandanavalue = '<string>B49Q-A7IE-E18K-EYDO</string>' where bandanakey = 'confluence.server.id' and BANDANAID <> 0;	


​	
Start Confluence on node 1 with v5.9.5 (20 min)
