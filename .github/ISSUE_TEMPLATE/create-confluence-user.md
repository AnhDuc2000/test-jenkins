Hello,

Rob our automated support assistant will help you with this request.

Before going any further, please be aware that <b>GitHub</b> is the DXC tool of choice for managing code and product documentation. You only should use Confluence for very specific use cases like for example a private team wiki / collaboration space.

For detailed information on the recommended DevOps toolchain, including a presentation video, visit the <a href="https://github.dxc.com/pages/bionix/storefront/products/devops/devcloud/">DevCloud</a> page.

If you still require a Confluence account just enter your email address below and submit the issue.

Notes:
* We do not currently support external users. All users must provide a DXC email for authentication purposes.
* It might take up to 1 hour before the new account is visible in Confluence.
* After obtaining your user account in Confluence, you may not see any spaces when logging in. After getting your account setup, you can request your space administrator to add you to their space roles.

E-mail Address:
