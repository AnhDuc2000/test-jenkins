### NOTE:
* HTML will allow you to view the space as static web pages.
* XML format can be re-imported into Confluence.
* PDF creates a single document with all the content from your space.
* You will be presented with options relevant to the export format you chose. Follow the on-screen prompts to finish the export process.
